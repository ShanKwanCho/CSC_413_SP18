There are two projects to implement which both are 2D game projects. The first game
project is TankGame Project and the second one is Katch&Pop. For the TankGame Project, there
are two players game and the objective of the game is to attack and destroy the opponents of each
players and to get the higher scores. For the Katch&Pop Game which is second game project, the
objective of the game is to hit the Octopus(Big Leg) to get the highest score.

The main idea of the both game projects are introducing and implementing one of the most
essential strategies in software development industry which is understanding the knowledge of the
Object Orient Programming (OOP) such as hierarchy of inheritance, encapsulation and
polymorphism. The structures of both game project are similar which can be reused most of the
classes ideally using the strategies of the inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
